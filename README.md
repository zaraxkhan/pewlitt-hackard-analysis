# Pewlitt-Hackard-Analysis
Pewlitt Hackard is a large company boasting over thousands of employees and has been around for a long time. As baby-boomers begin to retire at a rapid pace, Pewlitt Hackard is looking toward the future. First it is offering a retirement package to eligible employees and also asking questions such as which positions will become soon availible due to this retirement wave as thousands of positions will become open. Bobby is an HR hire and is tasked with figuring out who will be retiring within the next year and how many positions will become availible. With my help, he will come up with a list of employees who will be retiring and build an employee database. 

## Overview
With the Use of SQL and PGAdmin 4, I will be aiding Bobby and his company to help determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This information will help Pewlitt Hackard prepare for the 'silver tsunami' of employees who will be getting ready to retire shortly. The mentorship program will ease the transition for new employees to fill the shoes of those before them.
