# Pewlitt-Hackard-Analysis
Pewlitt Hackard is a large company boasting over thousands of employees and has been around for a long time. As baby-boomers begin to retire at a rapid pace, Pewlitt Hackard is looking toward the future. First it is offering a retirement package to eligible employees and also asking questions such as which positions will become soon availible due to this retirement wave as thousands of positions will become open. Bobby is an HR hire and is tasked with figuring out who will be retiring within the next year and how many positions will become availible. With my help, he will come up with a list of employees who will be retiring and build an employee database. 

## Overview
With the Use of SQL and PGAdmin 4, I will be aiding Bobby and his company to help determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This information will help Pewlitt Hackard prepare for the 'silver tsunami' of employees who will be getting ready to retire shortly. The mentorship program will ease the transition for new employees to fill the shoes of those before them. 

## Results
Below I share the results from the analysis. 

### Figure 1: Retirement Titles

-The first analysis I ran shared which employees, along with their title and start dates, were eligible to retire within the next few years. I ran this analysis by filtering the birth dates between 1/1/1952 and 12/31/1965 as this age group would be retiring in a few years. Figure 1, above, shows this data. However, many employees are duplicated within this analysis as they have moved positions or departments and have multiple titles throughout the company. Because of this, employee names are repeated and does not give the exact number of actual employees leaving.

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
